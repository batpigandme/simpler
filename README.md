# Starting Out with R and Shiny
#### Oliver Keyes

This is a book-formatted set of tutorials and lecture notes from a course taught in Springfield, IL on starting out with R, for the purpose of building Shiny apps (particularly Shiny Dashboards!)

It contains:

1. An introduction to R as a language, its history, and its structure;
2. A basic guide to RStudio and online help resources for questions, bugs or commentary;
3. Importing data into R from databases or flat files;
4. Cleaning and reshaping that data with tidyr, dplyr, stringi, lubridate and related tools;
5. Shiny as a data visualisation platform;
6. Miscellaneous more-advanced tips and tricks on running Shiny in a reliable manner.

If you're interested in using or republishing it yourself, the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Ironholds/simpler); simply download it, navigate to the r_shiny directory, and you'll find a perfectly web-formatted booklike structure!
