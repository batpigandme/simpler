# Preamble

Welcome to *Starting Out with R and Shiny*, a guide to learning basic R and ending up with the ability to put together [Shiny dashboards](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) - online, R-based dashboards and visualisations.

This set of documentation is being written for a set of lectures in Springfield, IL, and is primarily aimed at those attendees - it will hopefully be useful to others too. It contains (or will contain):

1. An introduction to R as a language, its history, and its structure;
2. A basic guide to RStudio and online help resources for questions, bugs or commentary;
3. Importing data into R from databases or flat files;
4. Cleaning and reshaping that data with tidyr, dplyr, stringi, lubridate and related tools;
5. Shiny as a data visualisation platform;
6. Miscellaneous more-advanced tips and tricks on writing and running R and Shiny in a reliable manner.
